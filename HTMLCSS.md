HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

The header and footer elements can be used for: 
The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. 
A header or footer for an individual  article or section within the page.

the  header element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The footer  element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions. 

The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation. 

The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

The aside  element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an  article element or not. When the aside element is used inside an  article element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. 

The section  element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. 
if you have a page with a long article, the section element can be used to split the article up into separate sections.

The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more  h1 through h6  elements so that they are treated as one single heading.

figure figcaption
can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).
figcaption element which provides a text decription for the content of the figure element.

the div  element will remain an important way to group together related elements.

HTML5 allows web page authors to place an  a  element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
