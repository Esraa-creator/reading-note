Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything
between the opening tag and the closing tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.

When linking to other pages
within the same site, you can
use relative URLs. These are like
a shorthand version of absolute
URLs because you do not need
to specify the domain name.

On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

the directory structure for a
fictional entertainment listings
website called ExampleArts.

Relationships
The relationship between
files and folders on a website
is described using the same
terminology as a family tree.

Homepa ges
The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a
child folder) is called index.html.

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

mailto:the value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
a tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a div
(or other block-level) element.

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

In normal flow, each block-level
element sits on top of the next
one.

Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.

The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

The clear property allows you
to say that no element (within
the same containing element)
should touch the left or righthand
sides of a box.

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

 Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

Grids help create professional and flexible designs.


CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.


You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope

JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
