src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images — relative URLs
were covered on pages 83-84).
alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the img element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

The align attribute can take
these horizontal values:
left
This aligns the image to the left
(allowing text to flow around its
right-hand side).
right
This aligns the image to the right
(allowing text to flow around its
left-hand side).

Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

Hue
Hue is near to the colloquial idea
of color. Technically speaking
however, a color can also have
saturation and brightness as
well as hue.
Saturation
Saturation refers to the amount
of gray in a color. At maximum
saturation, there would be no
gray in the color. At minimum
saturation, the color would be
mostly gray.
Brigh tness
Brightness (or "value") refers
to how much black is in a color.
At maximum brightness, there
would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the
color would be very dark.

Serif fonts have extra details on
the end of the main strokes of
the letters.

Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters and therefore
have a much cleaner design.

pixels
Pixels are commonly used
because they allow web
designers very precise control
over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is
followed by the letters px.
percentages
The default size of text in
browsers is 16px. So a size of
75% would be the equivalent of
12px, and 200% would be 32px

You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
 You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.

These are some of the major differences between the three most popular image formats for web — JPEG, PNG and GIF. To summarise once again, use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
