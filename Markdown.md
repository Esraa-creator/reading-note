Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; 
formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just 
a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 

Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
*This text will be italic*
__This will also be bold__

Lists
Unordered
* Item 1
* Item 2
Ordered
1. Item 1
1. Item 2

GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features.
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), 
and then separating each column with a pipe | .

Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention” .
Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
