Getting Started with GitHub Pages.

Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.
On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
Your website’s files will live in a repository named username.github.io

To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab.
In  GitHub Pages section near the bottom ,Click the Choose a theme button to start the process of creating your site.

One of the first things you can do is remove the default title of your index page, and add a friendlier message to it.
 Since this is a very quick change – and your first one – you’re going to make it on the default branch: main.
View the _config.yml file by navigating to it in the Code tab. You can edit the file by clicking on the pencil icon.
Under title, you can add a message about the purpose of the page.

You have two places to write abouta change: a subject and an extended description. The extended description is
 optional, so let’s leave a descriptive message in the subject.
When you’re done, click Commit changes and your updates will go live in just a few seconds!
