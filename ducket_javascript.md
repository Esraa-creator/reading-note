A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

Examples :
RECIPES By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.
Another similarity is that, if you are new to cooking or programming, there is a lot of new terminology to learn.

HANDBOOKS Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to follow in certain situations.
Similarly, in a complex script, the browser might use only a subset of the code available at any given time

MANUALS Mechanics often refer to car repair manuals when servicing models they are not familiar with. These manuals contain a series of tests to check the key functions of the car are working, along with details of how to fix any issues that arise.
Similarly, scripts can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that action is appropriate.

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 1: DEFINE THE GOAL
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3: CODE EACH STEP

Computers are very logical and obedient. They need to be told every detail of what they are expected to do, and they will do it without question. Because they need different types of instructions compared to you or I, everyone who learns to program makes lots of mistakes at the start.


Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE . var color= 'beige'; The value of co 1 or is now beige.

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
var area = 3 * 2; The value of area is now 6.

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable color= 'beige'; The value of co 1 or is now beige. 
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math area = 3 * 2; The value of area is now 6. 
STRING OPERATORS 
Combine two strings greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly'; The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.

COMPARISON OPERATORS 
Compare two values and return true or false buy = 3 > 5; The value of buy is false

LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); The value of buy is now true

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation.

When you place quotes around a num~er, it is a string (not a numeric data type), and you cannot perform addition operations on strings.

If you try to add a numeric data type to a string, then the number becomes part of the string.

If you try to use any of the other arithmetic operators on a string, then the value that results is usually a value called NaN. This means "not a number."

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

The function acts like a store; it holds the statements that are contained in the curly braces until you are ready to use them. Those statements are not run until the function is called. The function is only called on the last line of this script
