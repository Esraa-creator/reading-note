# How Forms Work
* A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
* The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects.

* The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB.net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database.

* The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received.

A form may have several form controls, each
gathering different information. The server
needs to know which piece of inputted data
corresponds with which form element.

Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.


* When an event occurs, the event object tells
you information about the event, and the
element it happened upon.

Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).

Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.

You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.

The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
