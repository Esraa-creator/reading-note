## Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
In order to view a web page,
users might type a web address
into their browser.

Remember that many computer owners will not
be running the latest versions
of these browsers.

## Web server
 which hosts the website.
Web servers are special
computers that are constantly
connected to the Internet, and
are optimized to send web pages
out to people who request them.

a web hosting company who
charge a fee to host your site.
Devices People are accessing websites.

remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.

## Screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

screen readers are
also being used in other areas
where people are unable read a
screen, such as when they are
driving or jogging.

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.


Each web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using.

If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->

they can be viewed by anyone who looks at
the source code behind the page.

Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page.

giving an element a unique identity allows you to
style it differently than any other
instance of the same element
on the page.


The class attribute
you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others


Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.
Examples of block elements are
h1, p, ul, and li .

<p>Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.

Examples of inline elements are
a, b, em, and img.
</p>

<p>The div element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.

In a browser, the contents of
the div element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page. </p>

<p> The span element acts like
an inline equivalent of the div
element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text
2. Contain a number of inline
elements.

they can control the
appearance of the content of
these elements using CSS.</p>

<p>An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.

The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the
frame.

The scrolling attribute will
not be supported in HTML5. In
HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates
whether the iframe should
have scrollbars or not.

The frameborder attribute will
not be supported in HTML5

a new attribute
called seamless can be applied
to an iframe where scrollbars
are not desired.</p>

pragma
This prevents the browser from
caching the page.

Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

<p>The header and footer
elements can be used for:
The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
A header or footer for an
individual article or
section within the page.


The nav element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.


The section element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

The purpose of the hgroup
element is to group together a
set of one or more h1 through
h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading


Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.</p>

<p>Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.

To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.
This involves placing each
piece of information that a
visitor might need to know on
a separate piece of paper and
then organizing the related
information into groups.

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
