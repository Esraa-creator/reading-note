### More about files:
Everything in linux is actually a file.
We specified the command line argument as path instead of file, it is a means to get to a particular location in the system and that location is a file.

cd moves into whichever directory is specified by the first command line argument only.

If the file or directory's name begins with a . (full stop) then it is considered to be hidden.

### Basic Navigation
pwd which stands for Print Working Directory,It tells you what your current or present working directory is.

A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ) Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

### The command line
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.

**Shell**:This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash . echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.


Linux is full of shortcuts: he first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

I would like to use Visual Studio Code, it has has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS,which make it easier to deal with.
