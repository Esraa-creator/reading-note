* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.


*  Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.


* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.


* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

* rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up.

* hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign

* color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers.

You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names


Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.


CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

**Hue** is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.

**Saturation** is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.



**Lightness** is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.


* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
