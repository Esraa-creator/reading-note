Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs

Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms.

HTML has six "levels" of
headings.

By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.

The sup element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates

sub It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas.

When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing.

to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag br /.

you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the hr /

Visual editors often resemble
word processors. Although
each editor will differ slightly,
there are some features that
are common to most editors
that allow you to control the
presentation of text.

Code views show you the code
created by the visual editor so
you can manually edit it, or so
you can just enter new code
yourself. It is often activated
using a button with an icon
that says HTML or has angled
brackets. White space may be
added to the code by the editor
to make the code easier to read.

The s element indicates
something that is no longer
accurate or relevant

The address element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.

cite element can be used
to indicate where the citation is
from.

A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value

When a CSS property does
not display as expected, it
is generally referred to as a
browser quirk or CSS bug

CSS selectors are case sensitive,
so they must match element
names and attribute values
exactly.

The style element should use
the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in
CSS.

href
This specifies the path to the
CSS file (which is often placed in
a folder called css or styles).

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

JS:

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks. The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon.

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.

The quotes can be single or double quotes, but they must match.

The backwards slash tells the interpreter that the following character is part of the string, rather than the end of it.

You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword

You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value:

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation.

DECISIONS Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down. 
LOOPS There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly. 

At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a true or false value.


Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
